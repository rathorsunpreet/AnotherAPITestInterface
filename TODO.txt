Add the following commands:
1. chart - runs report in background and then either appends or writes to JSONdb file which is then used to create a chart
2. charttype=line - specify which chart type to create
3. memory=on - switch to use, default is off. This sets whether append or over-write action on JSONdb needs to take place

For charts use billboard.js / charts.js . These two are ES Modules, use dynamic import with them.
